**Media over QUIC** (MoQ) is a new live media protocol that fully leverages
[QUIC](https://quicwg.org/). QUIC is a relatively new transport protocol that powers
[HTTP/3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3) but can be used independently as a super-charged
TCP/UDP replacement. Browser support is available via
[WebTransport](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebTransport).

### Try it out! [Watch](/watch) a public broadcast or [Publish](/publish) your own.

Existing live media protocols fill a niche, targetting a certain use-case and a certain latency
budget. We are designing a protocol that is flexible enough to support the wide range of use-cases:
from ultra-low latency to ultra-high quality, 1 viewer to 1 million viewers, and everything in
between.

### Read the [Explained](/explained) section for the gritty technical details.

This website is a fully [open source](/github) proof-of-concept. It's written in Rust and Typescript
with multiple libraries available. Get in touch if you're interested in contributing, sponsoring, or
just want more information!

### Visit our [Github](/github) or join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/FCYF3p99mr).

The protocol is being developed by the
[IETF MoQ working group](https://datatracker.ietf.org/group/moq/about/). The
[IETF](https://www.ietf.org/) is an open organization that develops Internet standards, including
some of your _favorite_ protocols like HTTP, TLS, and DNS. It's still early in development and
everything is subject to change, so get involved!
